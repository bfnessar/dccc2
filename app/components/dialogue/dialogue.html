    <h2>Introduction, Topic</h2>
    <p>
      As part of my application for the role of Junior Front-End Developer, I submit this single-page Angular-framework application.
      My programming assignment is to use an open JSON feed to "tell a meaningful story".
      This application pulls <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.ct.gov/u2qy-687x">publicly-accessible data</a>
      from the state of Connecticut's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will focus my research on the topic of opioid-related overdose deaths in the state of Connecticut in the year 2015.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      I would like to begin with a disclaimer. This assignment is meant as a demonstration of my abilities as a web developer. I will do my best to be honest and informative, and to
      treat this topic with the seriousness that it deserves. However, my ultimate goal is to prove my skills as a programmer and not as a researcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that said, my presentation will be formatted in the following way:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Background of the issue</li>
      <li>Hypothesis</li>
      <li>Explanation of the data source and the API</li>
      <li>Examination of the data</li>
      <li>Analysis and conclusions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I first heard about the surge of opioid-overdose deaths from someone on CSPAN sometime last year.
      As far as <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/">drug epidemics go</a>,
      this one is relatively recent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very simply put, people are becoming addicted to prescription painkillers. I think it starts when someone is injured or
      otherwise in chronic physical pain. They are then prescribed opioids by their doctors. After some time, they become dependent
      on the substance. Perhaps the source of their discomfort was never addressed. Perhaps they developer a psychological or physical addiction.
      Either way, that's one way that the story starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This epidemic has caught the eye of lawmakers, which is a good sign. In July 2016, Congress passed
      <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/524">the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA)</a>,
      a bipartisan effort to deal with the issue on a national level.

    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>
      If you Google <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=opioid+epidemic">"opioid epidemic"</a>, you can see that the topic has been written about by such sources as
      <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/">the Department of Health and Human Services</a>,
      <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/03/daily-chart-3">The Economist</a>,
      <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/">the Center for Disease Control and Prevention</a>,
      <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170302-chelsea-clinton-america-is-suffering-an-opioid-epidemic">BBC</a>,
      <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/12/17/orphaned-by-americas-opioid-epidemic/?utm_term=.71a83d2ba36d">the Washington Post</a>,
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/opioid-crisis-epidemic.html?_r=0">the New York Times</a>, and
      <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/11/health/sanjay-gupta-prescription-addiction-doctors-must-lead/">CNN</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we can see, there has been a lot of commentary on this topic. For my presentation, I would like to examine the hypothesis that this epidemic
      <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/08/18/the-opioid-epidemic-for-whites-only/?utm_term=.daefe212f024">
        disproportionately affects white Americans
      </a>.

    <h2>About the Data Source</h2>
    <p>
      Like I said before, my data comes from <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.ct.gov/u2qy-687x">this</a>
      public API. The data is provided by the state of Connecticut, and hosted by <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>.
      The source provides 657 records of drug-related deaths, along with dates, locations, demographic data about the victim, and the specific causes of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socrata's <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/">SoDA</a> API allows consumers to use SQL-like language to make specific queries
      on the dataset. My API query is structured in the following way:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      https://data.ct.gov/resource/u2qy-687x.json?$query=SELECT date, sex, race, age, death_city WHERE any_opioid = 'Y' ORDER BY date
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You can visit the given url to see the data for yourself.
      Strictly speaking, we only need the race selector and the opioid filter to answer this hypothesis.
      But the additional information is interesting, and provides a little extra context.
    </p>

  <div ng-switch-when="5">
    <h2>The data</h2>

    <!-- <md-button ng-click="model.initializeGraph()">init()</md-button> -->
    <graph-window-directive model="model.graph_object"></graph-window-directive>

    <p>
      As we can see, out of the 657 deaths in the database, 543 of them were of white Americans.
      That comes out to 82.6% of recorded opioid overdoses.
    </p>

    <p>As a side note, the six 'Other'-category records broke down as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 "Unknown"</li>
      <li>1 "Other"</li>
      <li>1 "Asian, Other"</li>
      <li>1 "Chinese"</li>
      <li>and one record simply did not have a value for the "race" attribute</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div ng-switch-when="6">
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
      It appears that the data provided by the state of Connecticut <i>does</i> support our hypothesis.
      In general, men have a higher death count than women, regardless of race. I've also broken down
      the data by age range. The only conclusion I can draw from that data is that the death rate drops off
      significantly after the age of 60.
    </p>

    <p>
      There we have it. Like I said in the beginning, I'm not here to provide any analysis about these
      results, nor to make any kind of socioeconomic commentary on the subject. Just <b>hypothesis</b>,
      <b>data</b>, <b>conclusion</b>. If I had more time, I think I would like to make a graph out of this data.
      We could repeat this breakdown for each year leading up to 2015, put the data on a line graph, and
      view the trends of the data over time.
