    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As part of my application for the role of Front-End Developer, I submit this single-page application. This application pulls data from a few JSON feeds (sources appear at the end of the presentation) and attempts to "tell a meaningful story".</p>
    <p>After browsing the suggested data sources (all of which are provided by <a href="http://catalog.data.gov">catalog.data.gov</a>), I decided to focus my research on opioid-related deaths in the United States.</p>

    <h2>About the "Opioid Epidemic"</h2>
    <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services refers to this phenomenon as the "Opioid Epidemic" <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/">on its page on the topic</a>.</p>
    <p>
      If you Google <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=opioid+epidemic">"opioid epidemic"</a>, you can see that the topic has been written about by such sources as

      So there's a lot of commentary on this subject. There's probably lots of fascinating socioeconomic implications of this phenomenon.
      Smarter people than me have said plenty about it, and I implore you to research the topic.
      People die from opioid overdoses every day, and it is a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>That said</b>, I'm not really here to provide any kind of in-depth analysis.
        I don't have any groundbreaking theories or meaningful political analysis on this subject.
        If you've already heard of the opioid epidemic, then I won't be telling you anything you don't already know.
        I'm not a historian, a sociologist, or a statistician. I'm simply here to demonstrate my ability to
        deploy a single-page website that can make REST-based API calls using AngularJS.

    <h2>Presentation Format</h2>
    <p>
      At first I wasn't sure how I would format this presentation. I did some research, and found
      <a href="http://www.vox.com/a/how-the-us-is-changing">this</a> article on <i>Vox</i>.
      The format of the article is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make an assertion.</li>
      <li>Present a graph that supports that assertion</li>
      <li>Provide commentary that elaborates on the graph and maybe even makes further assertions based on the graphed data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Seems like a good model. I have one minor adjustment, however.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like I said a moment ago, I'm not here to make assertions. Let's instead call them <i>hypotheses</i>. I'll make a claim, we'll query some data, and we'll see if the data supports that claim.
